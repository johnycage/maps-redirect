# maps-redirect
Redirect the users to either Google Maps or Bing Maps (powered by Here Maps), depending upon the mobile device they are using. 

Originally created in ~circa 2014. 
Now, may seem irrelevant in 2019, as Nokia sold off Here.com & started using Android OS for their devices. Still useful in case of Windows Phones.
(it's a monopoly of Google Maps) I have not added Apple Maps.

#### How to Use

Edit [user-agent.php](https://github.com/johnycage/maps-redirect/blob/master/user-agent.php) file to change the location/ cordinates from 0.0000 to desired latitute and longitute. The direct link can be obtained from Google Maps for line #18 and Bing Maps for line #13
