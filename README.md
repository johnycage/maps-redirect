# maps-redirect
Redirect the users to either Google Maps or Bing Maps (powered by Here Maps), depending upon the mobile device they are using. 

Originally created in ~circa 2014. 
Now, may seem irrelevant in 2019, as Nokia sold off Here.com & started using Android OS for their devices. Still useful in case of Windows Phones.
(it's a monopoly of Google Maps) I have not added Apple Maps.
