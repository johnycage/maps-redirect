# maps-redirect
Redirect the users to either Google Maps or Here Maps, depending upon the mobile device they are using. 

Originally created in ~circa 2014. 
Now, may seem irrelevant in 2019, as Nokia sold off Here.com & started using Android OS for their devices. 
(it's a monopoly of Google Maps) 
I have not added Apple Maps.
